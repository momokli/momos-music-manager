## Plan: tag-curation-page

**Status**: done ✅
**Branch**: `feat/tag-curation-page`
**Ready for review**: yes
**Depends on**: `feat/tag-parents`
**Migration needed**: no

### Description

A dedicated curation workflow page for going through Setlist tags and assigning parent tags efficiently. Combines a sequential workflow (prev/next through the queue) with a browsable table to jump around, plus smart search that can add existing tags or create-and-add new ones inline.

### Backend Changes

- **`src/db.rs`**: `get_curation_queue()` — returns Setlist tags with parent counts, file counts, and full parent tag details as JSON. Filterable by search, has_parents (yes/no/any), sortable by name/length/files/parents.
- **`src/api.rs`**: `GET /api/tags/curation-queue` endpoint with `CurationQueueQuery` params

### Frontend Changes

- **`frontend/pages/tag-curation.js`** — new 950-line page module with:
  - Top nav bar: prev/next with progress bar (keyboard shortcuts ←/→ or p/n)
  - Tag card: big tag name, metadata
  - Parent tags editor: chips with remove, typeahead search with "Add" button, inline "Create & Add" popover (category picker → create → add as parent)
  - Browse All: collapsible mini table of Setlist tags with search/sort/filter, click to jump
  - Auto-save: every add/remove immediately PUTs parents; navigation waits for in-flight saves
- **`frontend/app.js`**: register `"tag-curation"` in PAGE_MAP
- **`frontend/shared/nav.js`**: add "Tag Curation" link to TOOLS_ITEMS

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Curation queue lists all Setlist tags sorted by name length (descending)
- [x] Search filter works (by tag name)
- [x] has_parents filter works (yes/no/any)
- [x] Sort by name/length/files/parents works
- [x] Each result includes parent tag details (id, name, category, icon)
- [x] Parent chips show category badges with correct colors
- [x] Typeahead search finds existing tags and can add them as parents
- [x] "Create & Add" flow creates a new tag and immediately adds as parent
- [x] Removing a parent chip removes the parent relationship
- [x] Auto-save: changes persist immediately via API
- [x] Navigation (prev/next/jump) works with auto-save
- [x] Backend compiles (`cargo build`)
- [x] Tested with curl
